# Loan-Repayment-Prediction-using-Big-Data

These days, Loan fraud cases are surging drastically due to the inefficient and traditional loan repayment prediction methods. The main reason behind this could be the unnoticeable social behavior of a loan applicant over a particular timestamp. So, our key focus would be on extracting crucial knowledge from remarkably raising Big Data that would make a significant surge in the accuracy of Loan Repayment Prediction. Approximately, 70% of the Big Data includes Unstructured data (audio, text, video, etc) which is present in various data islands e.g. Social, IoT, Public, Private, etc.

In this paper, we focused on Social & IoT data islands because they provide a large amount of user-generated data on a continuous basis. The process of transforming raw data into contextualized data (curated data) is not an easy procedure as it includes figuring out the vital data sources, extracting data and knowledge, cleaning, maintaining, merging, enriching and linking data and knowledge. While curating the social data we introduced a Data Analytics Pipeline i.e. CrowdCorrect, which is a blend of crowdsourcing and algorithmic methods to deal with redundancies, abbreviations, slangs, misspellings, etc. Nevertheless, for IoT data we used iProcess, for data ingestion, knowledge extraction, linking, data summarizing using OLAP, & using Machine Learning as a service. 

We presented a scenario in understanding the social behavior of our loan applicant by analyzing his Social & IoT based data. We evaluated our approach by analyzing his/her social behavior, physical presence near the property, & connections with named entities related to the loan. Therefore, we can present a personality overview of a loan applicant.
